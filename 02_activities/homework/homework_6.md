**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Homework 6:
For the article “When Databases Get to Define Family”, it demonstrates how we design the data structure could adversely affect the people that it was bound to serve. It highlights the inequalities of the society and reinforces it more whether it was intentional or not.

The only way I can think of in correcting these past mistakes is by starting over their database. They need to design it in such a way that all stakeholders have an equal importance on what the system would be like. They need to understand the needs and experiences of different sectors of their society. The system they have should also be able to accommodate things that can evolve in their society in the future.
They should also proactively engage and reach out to non-traditional households and marginalized communities to identify the specific barriers they face so that they could create policies that would promote equitable access to services for everyone.

Moreover, they need to make a way for this data to be transparent on how it is stored, shared and processed. They should also have a way to that people could fix errors in an efficient and cost-effective way. Since the data they have contains a lot of private and sensitive information, they should have oversight mechanism and strong cybersecurity measures so that this would never fall into the hands of bad actors.

The 2nd article, Neural nets are just people all the way down, is really interesting for me since I’ve dipped my toes on these types of jobs that trains AI. It involved doing tasks that just literally pay pennies. I can’t justify to myself the cost vs benefits that I’ll get from it. I was hoping to earn a decent amount of money from it as a side job but I felt like I was wasting my time especially at the end of the day I’ll only be earning a few dollars. It’s a very menial and humbling job which mostly target people from developing countries. They’re treated as freelancers with no job security and benefits but have ridiculous goals to attain each week.

With this method of training AI, I think it would embed biases in the data and only shaped by the judgment of the labour force that is in a low-wage country that is focused on just reaching their quota for the day.
In order to effectively integrate equality and ethics in AI, there needs to be transparency and accountability. Companies should adopt ethical labor practices, have fair treatment and compensation for their workers. There should also be better representation from different cultures and sectors of the society which hopefully can mitigate the bias in the algorithms.
